# STAR WARS CUB3D

## Preamble

This project is the second graphical project of 42 school.
The main purpose is to create a rather simple game using RayCasting techniques.


## Dependencies

The project is compiled using the [MiniLibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git).
We also have access to the follow functions :
	• open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, gettimeofday
	• All functions of the math library (-lm man man 3 math)
All other functions must be created by ourselves. (Bonus parts allows for some forbidden functions, see Rule of Cool.)
Our base library for this project is our own [Libft](https://github.com/CodeWithCharles/42_libft_full.git) containing all the re-usable work we've done so far.
